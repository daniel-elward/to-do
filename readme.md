The Odin Project: To Do List

Requirements of the app...

1: Your ‘todos’ are going to be objects that you’ll want to dynamically create

2: At a minimum they (todos) should have a title, description, dueDate and priority

3: Your todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’ project to which all of their todos are put. Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.

--- Functionality ---

4: View all projects.

5: View all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate… perhaps changing color for different priorities).

6: Expand a single todo to see/edit its details.

7: Delete a todo.

8: Use localstorage to have some persistence.
